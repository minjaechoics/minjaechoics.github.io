# Welcome to MinJae Wiki

Welcome to **MinJae Wiki** — a public knowledge base documenting my academic and personal learning journey.

---

## 📚 What is included?

This wiki primarily contains knowledge learned from courses in:

- **Computer Science**
- **Electrical and Electronic Engineering**
- **Industrial Design**

at KAIST.

In addition, it includes:
- Personal study notes
- Debugging logs and technical problem-solving records
- Paper reviews and research-related summaries

All content is written in **Markdown** and **English**, with an emphasis on clarity, structure, and long-term reusability.

---

## 🛠 What features does it provide?

Beyond functioning as a traditional wiki, this project is designed to evolve.

Planned features include:
- **LLM-powered semantic search** for fast knowledge retrieval
- Custom **AI agents** to assist with learning, review, and cross-referencing concepts

The goal is to turn accumulated notes into an actively usable knowledge system.

## 🌍 Why is this wiki public?

This wiki was created to **minimize career and knowledge discontinuity during mandatory military service** while enrolled in university.

By keeping knowledge structured, searchable, and public:
- I can maintain continuity in my learning and research
- Others who studied **Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or Industrial Design** and later return from military service may find it helpful

If this wiki helps even a small number of returning students resume their academic or technical trajectory more smoothly, it has served its purpose.

Feel free to explore, reference, and reuse the content where helpful.
